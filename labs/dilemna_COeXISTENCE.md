# Future cities dilemma 

## 1. Urban mobility is inefficient and unsustainable. 
Cities are crowded, congsted. Cars are noisy, smelly and dangerous. 
We are looking forward to see cities:
* safe,
* green,
* accesible,
* car-free.
## 2. Humans make selfish transport decisions: they maximise their perceived own utility (want to arrive home fast at low cost)
Each of our trips (obligatory or not) is made in the way *optimal* to us.
This refers to:
* destination (which shopping mall/gym/restaurant/cafe)
* departure time (now or later)
* which mode (bike, car, bus)
* which route (pathfinding)


And our decision is subject to:
* time (arrive faster)
* cost (cheaper)
* comfort
* safety
* percpetion (e.g. I do not like bike, I like bus, I love car)

> We are 'utility maximisers' - we do what we want and what is best for us.


## 3. The urban mobility systems are in the so-called `equilibrium`.
from game-theory the systems are in `Nash Equilubrium`, i.e.: *No single traveller can impvoe her utility by changing her actions*.

## 4. There is an opmtimum

System optimum is the state of the system, where actions are tkaen jointly, at the system level. 

The objective is to miminise the **total** costs (e.g. mileage).

This saves the costs (emmission, time, noise), in practice by up to 20%

But this is not a social system anymore
