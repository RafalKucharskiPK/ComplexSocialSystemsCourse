# Future cities dilemma

## 1. Urban mobility is inefficient and unsustainable. 
Cities are crowded, congested. Cars are noisy, smelly and dangerous. 
We are looking forward to see cities:
* safe,
* green,
* accessible,
* car-free.

## 2. Social system

Humans make selfish transport decisions: they maximise their perceived own utility (want to arrive home fast at low cost).

Each of our trips (obligatory or not) is made in the way *optimal* to us.

This refers to:
* destination (which shopping mall/gym/restaurant/cafe)
* departure time (now or later)
* which mode (bike, car, bus)
* which route (pathfinding)


And our decision is subject to:
* time (arrive faster)
* cost (cheaper)
* comfort
* safety
* perception (e.g. I do not like bike, I like bus, I love car)

> We are 'utility maximisers' - we do what we want and what is best for us.



## 3. The urban mobility systems are in the so-called `equilibrium`.
from game-theory the systems are in `Nash Equilubrium`, 

i.e.: *No single traveller can improve her utility by changing her actions*.

## 4. There is an optimum

System optimum is the state of the system, where actions are taken jointly, at the system level. 

The objective is to minimise the **total** costs (e.g. mileage).

This saves the costs (emmission, time, noise), in practice by up to 20%

But this is not a social system anymore, this is **Amazon Warehouse**
